To deploy the add-ins to Visual Studio, follow these steps:
1. Build the project.
2. Copy the Assembly DLL file (for example, HeloWorld.dll) from the Bin folder and the .AddIn XML file (for example, HelloWorld.AddIn) from the root folder to 
[Install Drive]:\Users\[local user]\Documents\Visual Studio 2010\Addins\ in Visual Studio 2010 and 
[Install Drive]:\Users\[local user]\Documents\Visual Studio 2012\Addins\ in Visual Studio 2012

If you follow the steps as explained in the book, i.e. by using the wizard to create the project, Visual Studio will create a testing add-in and will place that in the Documents\VisualStudio\Addins folder for testing purposes.
